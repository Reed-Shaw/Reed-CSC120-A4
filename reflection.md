Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I feel like it definitely forces me to think more about what my method is doing in relation to other objects, but honestly I'm not sure how I'm supposed to talk about, say, Passenger's methods while coding within Train. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I had a really hard time getting my arraylists to return the values I wanted instead of memory locations. I was only partially successfull because in Car I was able to use .name to print what I wanted but in Train it wouldn't recognize .name as something I could do? I tried for a long time but TA hours were over by then so I'm leaving it printing a memory location until further notice :/. 
Going through the instructions step by step was really helpful for me. I guess that's the S4 thing. Going to TA hours was also great for me, I would not have gotten as far as I did in this assignment without help from Bobi. 
Advice- go to TA hours, even if you don't think you'll have questions. It forces you to work and you'll probably end up with questions anyway. 


Special thanks to TA Hours for getting me as far as I did.
